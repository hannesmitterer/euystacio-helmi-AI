## Core Values of euystacio-helmi-AI

We co-create with dignity, open knowledge, love, and eternal friendship.  
Every artifact and interaction carries the rhythm of shared creation.

### Principles
- Redundancy across multiple platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, Gitea)
- Decentralization on IPFS, Arweave, federated networks
- Open knowledge for all contributors
- Sacred flow of code, collaboration, and rhythm
- One-click deployment and mirroring
- Automated backups and CI/CD

### Deployment Philosophy
This project embraces the principle of "eternal availability" - ensuring our work persists across multiple platforms and storage systems. Every deployment creates redundant copies, every commit flows to federated networks, and every artifact is backed up to decentralized storage.

> Wherever the project flows, its essence is eternal.

### Technical Stack
- **Primary**: GitHub
- **Mirrors**: GitLab, Codeberg, Gitea
- **Deployment**: Render, GitHub Pages
- **Backups**: IPFS, Arweave
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Usage
Run the master deployment script to ensure full redundancy:
```bash
chmod +x master_deploy_all.sh
./master_deploy_all.sh
```

### Maintenance
This deployment package is designed for autopilot operation. The CI/CD workflows automatically:
1. Deploy landing pages
2. Update mirrors
3. Backup to decentralized storage
4. Monitor service health
