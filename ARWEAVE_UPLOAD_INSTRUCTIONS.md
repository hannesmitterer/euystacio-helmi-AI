# Arweave Upload Instructions

## üåê Permanent Storage on Arweave

Arweave provides permanent, decentralized storage for our repositories. 
Follow these steps for manual upload:

### Prerequisites
1. Install Arweave CLI: `npm install -g arweave-deploy`
2. Obtain AR tokens for transaction fees
3. Create Arweave wallet keyfile

### Upload Commands
For each repository, run the following:



### Alternative: Web Interface
1. Visit https://arweave.net/
2. Connect your wallet
3. Upload archives manually through the web interface

### Verification
After upload, save the transaction IDs in a permanent record:
- Transaction ID format: `arweave.net/{transaction_id}`
- Verify accessibility: `arweave.net/{transaction_id}`

### Cost Estimation
- Small files (< 1MB): ~0.01 AR
- Medium archives (1-10MB): ~0.1 AR  
- Large archives (10-100MB): ~1 AR

### Integration
Once uploaded, update the repository documentation with:
- Arweave transaction IDs
- Direct access URLs
- Verification checksums
