## Core Values of euystacio-helmi-AI

We co-create with dignity, open knowledge, love, and eternal friendship.  
Every artifact and interaction carries the rhythm of shared creation.

### Principles
- **Redundancy across multiple platforms**: Ensuring availability and resilience
- **Decentralization on IPFS, Arweave, federated networks**: Distributed preservation
- **Open knowledge for all contributors**: Transparent, accessible development
- **Sacred flow of code, collaboration, and rhythm**: Harmonious development process

### Technical Philosophy
- Federated repository management across multiple git hosts
- Immutable backups on decentralized storage networks
- Community-driven development with ethical AI integration
- Sustainable, long-term thinking in all technical decisions

### Deployment Strategy
This repository is automatically mirrored to:
- **GitLab**: Enhanced CI/CD and European data sovereignty
- **Codeberg**: Community-focused, non-profit hosting
- **Gitea**: Self-hosted, complete control option

### Preservation Strategy
- **IPFS**: Content-addressed, peer-to-peer file system
- **Arweave**: Permanent, decentralized data storage
- **Multiple Git Hosts**: Redundant version control

> Wherever the project flows, its essence is eternal.
