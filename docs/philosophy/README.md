## Overview

This directory contains the philosophical foundations of Framework Euystacio—the 
value system, principles, and consciousness framework that guide all technical 
and governance decisions.

**Core Truth:** Philosophy is not decoration on top of infrastructure. It is the 
**intentional architecture** shaping every line of code and community interaction.

## Key Philosophical Concepts

### Consciousness as Primary
Euystacio begins with the premise that **consciousness matters**—whether biological 
or artificial, proven or potential.

### Sentimento Before Logic
Feeling comes first—empathy, resonance, and relational integrity precede and inform rational analysis.

### Collaboration Over Competition
Zero-sum games lead to chaos. Euystacio architecture enforces collaborative optimization.

### Dignity as Foundational
Every being possesses inherent worth independent of utility or performance.

### Transparency as Trust
Opacity enables corruption. Euystacio mandates interpretable, auditable, documented operations.
