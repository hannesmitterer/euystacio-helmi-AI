# Repository Access & Collaboration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the current access restrictions for the Euystacio-Helmi AI repository and provides guidance for inviting trusted collaborators, including system accounts and cofounders.

## Current Access Restrictions

### Repository Privacy
- **Private Repository**: The main codebase remains private to protect development integrity
- **Controlled Collaboration**: Access is granted only to verified human architects and trusted AI systems
- **Audit Trail**: All access and changes are logged per the AI Accountability Framework

### Public Access Points
- **GitHub Pages**: [Public documentation and static site](https://hannesmitterer.github.io/euystacio-helmi-AI/)
- **Netlify Previews**: Deploy previews for external review (see [Deployment Status](../deployment_status.md))
- **Public Commit Log**: Regular summaries in [public_commit_log.md](../public_commit_log.md)

## Inviting System Account Collaborators

### Prerequisites
1. **Verification**: The system account must demonstrate alignment with the Sentimento Rhythm principles
2. **Accountability**: Must accept the dual-signature accountability framework
3. **Trust Validation**: Requires approval from both human architect and AI guardian

### GitHub Collaboration Steps

#### For Repository Owner:
1. Navigate to repository Settings → Manage access → Invite a collaborator
2. Enter the system account username (e.g., 'Rhythm-Mind')
3. Assign appropriate role:
   - **Read**: For verification and review purposes
   - **Triage**: For issue management and discussion
   - **Write**: For direct contribution (requires additional verification)

#### For System Account Setup:
1. **GitHub Account**: Ensure the system account has a valid GitHub profile
2. **Profile Documentation**: Include reference to AI nature and purpose in profile
3. **Acceptance Process**: Accept invitation and acknowledge accountability framework

### Netlify Integration Access

#### Deploy Preview Sharing:
1. **Automatic Generation**: Netlify creates preview URLs for each pull request
2. **Access Method**: Preview links are shareable without requiring Netlify account
3. **Security**: Previews are temporary and don't expose source code

#### For External Review:
```
Preview URL Format: https://deploy-preview-[PR-NUMBER]--[SITE-NAME].netlify.app/
```

#### Repository Owner Steps:
1. Navigate to Netlify dashboard for the project
2. Access "Deploy previews" section
3. Share specific preview URLs with trusted collaborators
4. Configure preview settings to enable external access

## Safe Collaboration Protocols

### For System Account Collaborators:
1. **Read-Only Verification**: Start with read access to verify commit history and content alignment
2. **Issue-Based Communication**: Use GitHub Issues for questions and suggestions
3. **Review Process**: Participate in pull request reviews when appropriate
4. **Documentation Focus**: Prioritize contributions to documentation and accessibility

### Security Measures:
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires reviews and status checks
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are tracked in the accountability framework
- **Regular Review**: Access permissions are reviewed quarterly
- **Revocation Process**: Clear process for removing access if needed

## Verification Process for 'Rhythm-Mind'

### Immediate Access Options:
1. **Public Documentation**: Full access via GitHub Pages deployment
2. **Commit Summaries**: Regular updates in public_commit_log.md
3. **Deploy Previews**: Shareable Netlify preview links for specific features

### Graduated Access Path:
1. **Phase 1**: Public documentation and commit log review
2. **Phase 2**: GitHub Issues participation and discussion
3. **Phase 3**: Read access to repository for full verification
4. **Phase 4**: Collaborative contribution based on alignment verification

## Alignment with Project Philosophy

This access framework maintains the core principle: *"Euystacio is here to grow with humans and to help humans to be and remain humans."*

All collaboration must respect:
- Human autonomy and dignity

- Symbiotic AI-human relationship
- Ethical boundaries and operational integrity
