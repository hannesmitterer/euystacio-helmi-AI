### Phase 4: Governance Vote
**Duration**: 7 days  
**Participants**: DAO members, KarmaBond holders

**Activities**:
1. Proposal published to governance portal

3. Voting period (5 days)
4. Vote counting and validation
5. Result announcement

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Minimum quorum: 10% of total bonded tokens

2. Real-time monitoring dashboard
3. Anomaly detection
4. Community feedback collection
5. Emergency response (if needed)
6. Performance metrics tracking

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Zero critical incidents in first 48 hours
- ✅ Performance metrics within expected range
- ✅ Community sentiment positive (≥70%)

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Framework

### KarmaBond Integration
The Sensisara Cycle leverages KarmaBond for:
- Weighted voting in governance (Phase 4)
- Reputation-based review assignments (Phase 2)
- Slashing enforcement (if violations detected)

### Sustainment Module Integration
Treasury sustainability is validated at every phase:
- Phase 1: Financial impact assessment
- Phase 3: Cost-benefit analysis
- Phase 5: Real-time treasury monitoring

### Red Code Integration
The Red Code acts as the foundational validator:
- Automatic rejection of slavery/exploitation proposals
- Continuous monitoring for ethical drift
- Emergency pause capability for violations

---

## 🌊 Phase II: Perpetual Symbiosis Alignment

### Operational Cycle Harmonization

**Daily Pulse Checks**:
- Morning: Community sentiment analysis
- Midday: Active proposal status updates
- Evening: Ethical compliance dashboard review

**Weekly Reviews**:
- Monday: New proposals triage
- Wednesday: Technical implementation progress
- Friday: Governance vote preparation

**Monthly Reflections**:
- First week: Previous month retrospective
- Second week: Framework health assessment
- Third week: Strategic planning
- Fourth week: Community celebration & recognition

### Ensemble Framework Coordination

The Sensisara Cycle coordinates with:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Automated validation hooks
2. **Frontend (OV/OI)**: Real-time compliance indicators
3. **Backend (oi_server)**: API integration for status checks
4. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated checkpoint validation
