     Expected Benefits:
     - 300% increase in global accessibility
     - Enhanced community diversity
     - Alignment with "Love First" principle
     ```

2. **Automatic ECD Validation**
   - Proposal submitted to ECD for ethical review
   - ECD Analysis:
     ```
     NSR Check: ✓ PASS (No slavery/coercion concerns)
     OLF Check: ✓ PASS (Increases love and accessibility)
     TFK Check: ✓ PASS (Positive karma alignment)
     Budget Check: ✓ PASS (Within treasury capacity)
     
     ECD Recommendation: APPROVED
     Ethical Score: 9.8/10
     ```
   - Proposal moves to community discussion phase

3. **Community Discussion Period (7 Days)**
   - Proposal appears in OI Governance Arena
   - Community members comment and ask questions:
     - Bob: "Can we prioritize languages based on user demographics?"
     - Carol: "Should we use machine translation or human translators?"
     - Dave: "What about right-to-left language support?"
   
   - Alice responds to questions and makes amendments:
     - Adds user demographic analysis
     - Specifies hybrid approach (machine + human validation)
     - Includes RTL support in implementation plan
   
   - Discussion metrics:
     - 47 participants
     - 123 comments
     - 89% positive sentiment

4. **Formal Voting Period (3 Days)**
   - Voting opens automatically after discussion period
   - Vote weight calculation for each voter:
     ```
     Voting Power = EUS Balance × (1 + Karma Score)
     
     Example:
     - Bob: 100 EUS × (1 + 0.5 karma) = 150 voting power
     - Carol: 50 EUS × (1 + 1.2 karma) = 110 voting power
     ```
   
   - Final Vote Tally:
     ```
     Total Voting Power Cast: 12,450
     In Favor: 11,205 (90%)
     Against: 1,245 (10%)
     
     Result: APPROVED
     ```

5. **Implementation Phase**
   - TrustlessFundingProtocol activates
   - Initial fund release: $2,000 (25% upfront)
   - Alice and development team begin work
   - Weekly progress updates posted to OI Arena
   
   - Milestone 1 (Week 2): Translation Infrastructure
     - Deliverable: Translation framework integrated
     - Community review: ✓ Approved
     - Fund release: $2,000 (next 25%)
   
   - Milestone 2 (Week 5): UI Components Updated
     - Deliverable: 15 languages integrated

- DAO Community
- Top Token Holders
- TFK System

**Detection Trigger**:

```
ECD Monitoring Alert:

Metric: Governance Decentralization
Threshold: Top 10 holders should control <50% of voting power
Current Status: Top 5 holders control 58% of voting power

Breakdown:
- Holder 1: 15% voting power
- Holder 2: 13% voting power
- Holder 3: 12% voting power
- Holder 4: 10% voting power
- Holder 5: 8% voting power
- Others: 42% voting power

Ethical Principle Violated: Participatory Governance
Red Code Status: YELLOW ALERT (not triggered, but concerning)
```

**Step-by-Step Flow**:

1. **ECD Analysis and Alert**
   - Automated analysis runs daily
   - Trend detection: Concentration increasing over past 30 days
   - ECD generates report:
     ```
     Centralization Risk Assessment

     Trend: WORSENING
     Time to Red Code: ~45 days (projected)
     
     Contributing Factors:
     1. Large token purchases by early adopters
     2. Inactive small holders (not participating)
     3. Karma accumulation favoring established members
     
     Recommendations:
     1. Implement voting power cap
     2. Increase karma weight for small holders
     3. Incentivize broader participation
     4. Token distribution mechanisms
     ```
   
   - Alert posted to OI Governance Arena
   - Email notification to all token holders

2. **Community Discussion (Week 1)**
   - 156 participants join discussion
   - Top holders voluntarily propose self-limitations:
     ```
     Statement from Large Holders:
     
     We recognize the concentration concern and propose:
     1. Voluntary 10% cap on individual voting power
     2. Delegation of excess voting power to community pool
     3. Mentorship program for new members
     4. Matching donations to small holder incentive fund
     ```
   
   - Small holders express concerns and suggestions:
     ```
     Small Holder Concerns:
     - Feel disenfranchised
     - Worried about plutocracy
     - Want guaranteed voice in governance
     
     Suggestions:
     - Quadratic voting mechanisms

     Title: Decentralization Enhancement Package
     
     Measures:
     
     1. Voting Power Cap
        - No single entity >15% of total voting power
        - Excess power delegated to community pool
        - Community pool votes proportionally with majority
     
     2. Quadratic Karma Boost
        - Small holders (<100 EUS): 2x karma multiplier
        - Medium holders (100-1000 EUS): 1.5x karma multiplier
        - Large holders (>1000 EUS): 1x karma multiplier
     
     3. Participation Incentives
        - Monthly active voter rewards: 10 EUS
        - Proposal submitters: Bonus karma
        - Discussion participants: Small EUS tips
     
     4. Token Distribution
