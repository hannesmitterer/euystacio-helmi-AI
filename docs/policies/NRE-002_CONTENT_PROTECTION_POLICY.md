# NRE-002: Content Protection and Anti-Censorship Policy

## Version: 2.0
## Status: ACTIVE - IMMUTABLE CORE PRINCIPLES
## Last Updated: 2025-12-10

---

## Purpose

This policy establishes systematic measures to protect content while preserving complete historical truth. It prevents censorship while supporting educational and memorial purposes through transparent, didactic frameworks.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Complete Truth Preservation (Anti-Manipulation)

**1.1 Immutable Archives**
- All historical content is protected through cryptographic hashing
- Version control ensures traceability of all changes
- Read-only repositories prevent unauthorized modifications
- Redundant storage across multiple trusted institutions (universities, NGOs)
- All modifications must be logged and auditable

**1.2 Technological Protection**
- SHA-256 hashing for content integrity verification
- Git-based version control for complete history
- Distributed storage for redundancy
- Tamper-evident audit logs

---

### 2. Trauma Reduction Without Information Loss

**2.1 Didactic, Age-Appropriate Preparation**

Content is organized into stratification levels:

- **Level 1: Basic Information** - Overview and context
- **Level 2: Detailed Context** - Comprehensive connections and analysis
- **Level 3: Complete Data** - Full archival material

This is curation, not filtering. All levels contain accurate information; the depth varies.

**2.2 Content Warnings + Voluntary Access**

- Clear warnings about sensitive content
- User voluntary decision for deeper exploration
- No forced exposure to traumatic content
- Informed consent at each access level

---

### 3. No Algorithmic Exclusion

**3.1 No Personalized Access Blocks**

The following restrictions are **PROHIBITED**:
- Age-based automatic blocking
- Trauma-history based filtering
- "Sufficient learning" based cutoffs
- Any algorithmic determination of "readiness"

Instead, the system provides:
- Recommendations and guidance
- Educational context
- Support resources
- Voluntary opt-in at each level

**3.2 Anti-Censorship Guarantee**

NRE-002 explicitly guarantees that:
- Complete access is never blocked
- Curation occurs through stratification, not censorship
- All original materials remain accessible
- No content is deleted or hidden

---

### 4. Democratic Control Over Centralized Filters

**4.1 Independent Historical Curator System**

Oversight provided by:
- Professional historians
- Educational specialists
- Mental health professionals
- Victim advocacy organizations

**4.2 Transparency Requirements**

- All editorial decisions must be documented
- Rationale for content stratification must be public
- Complete materials must remain accessible
- Regular audits of curation decisions

---

## System Implementation Requirements

### A. Anti-Censorship Clause

**IMMUTABLE REQUIREMENT**: NRE-002 must never block complete access. Curation occurs only through stratification, not censorship.

### B. Filter Definitions

**Didactic Filter** (PERMITTED):
- Emphasizes pedagogy and transparency
- Provides context and educational framing
- Organizes information by appropriate depth

**Block Filter** (PROHIBITED):
- Any measure that prevents access to complete information
- Any algorithmic determination of user "readiness"
- Any deletion or hiding of historical content

### C. User Control

**Always-Override-Option**:
- Users can access complete material at any time
- No mandatory progression through levels
- Instant access to Level 3 (complete data) available

**Zero-Obligation-Principle**:
- No forced user access
- All engagement is voluntary
- Users control their own journey

### D. Transparent Filter Protocols

**Audit Logging**:
- What was added to each level
- What was omitted from lower levels (but present in Level 3)
- Why curation decisions were made
- Who made the decisions

**Public Access**:
- Audit logs are publicly readable
- Decision rationale is transparent
- Appeal process for curation decisions

### E. ADi Definition

**ADi: Inspirational Synthesis from Facts**

ADi represents authentic, fact-based synthesis that:
- Draws inspiration from verified historical information
- Maintains factual accuracy
- Provides meaningful context
- Avoids manipulation or distortion

### F. Immutable AI Commitment

**Immutable AI Principles**:
- Fully readable and transparent
- Universally accessible
- No filtering by the AI systems themselves
- Complete preservation of all information
- Audit trail for all operations

---

## Enforcement

### Compliance Requirements

1. All content management systems must implement stratification
2. No automatic blocking mechanisms permitted
3. All curation decisions must be logged
4. User override options must be clearly available
5. Regular audits required

### Violation Response

Any violation of anti-censorship principles triggers:
1. Immediate system audit
2. Review by independent curators
3. Public disclosure of violation
4. Corrective action plan
5. Re-certification of compliance
