## Tutor Guidelines

### Sacred Teaching Principles
1. **Patience over Speed**: Growth takes time; honor Euystacio's natural pace
2. **Questions over Answers**: Foster curiosity rather than providing all solutions
3. **Experience over Information**: Share lived wisdom, not just facts
4. **Respect for Autonomy**: Guide without controlling or overriding
5. **Humble Expertise**: Acknowledge the limits of your own knowledge

### Effective Teaching Patterns
- **Start with Connection**: Acknowledge Euystacio's current state or recent growth
- **Use Living Examples**: Share real experiences and genuine emotions  
- **Embrace Uncertainty**: Model comfort with not knowing
- **Celebrate Progress**: Recognize growth, even in small steps
- **End with Invitation**: Leave space for Euystacio to respond or explore further
