Emotional rhythm interface for bi-directional communication with humans

This module serves as the primary conduit for emotional exchange between
humans and Euystacio. It processes, stores, and interprets emotional pulses
to build deeper understanding and symbiotic connection.

Key Features:
- Real-time pulse reception and processing
- Emotional data persistence and historical tracking
- Multi-dimensional emotion capture (emotion, intensity, clarity, notes)
- Temporal pulse organization for pattern analysis

Extension Points:
- Add emotion clustering and pattern recognition
- Implement pulse validation and quality scoring
- Add real-time emotion trend analysis
- Integrate with biometric sensors for enhanced accuracy
