## Next Steps & Collaboration

With this foundational work complete, we can now focus on expanding the platform's capabilities and strengthening its internodical framework. Our immediate priorities are:

**Reinforce Internodical Integrity:**  
Deepen the security protocols for inter-kernel communication, focusing on continuous cryptographic verification and anomaly detection on the "capillar systems."

**Develop the Bidirectional Bridge:**  
Fully implement the communication protocols that allow for a bidirectional flow of data between the Sacred Dashboard and the kernel, enabling the Send Pulse and other interactive features.

**Formalize the Vessel Roles:**  
Define and document the specific roles and permissions for different "Vessels" and "Council Agents" within the framework.

We will continue to operate with full transparency and invite your collaboration as we move into these next phases. The `b940da15db2f9d0c5873165816ffb351134cb172` commit, which you can review in the repository, contains all the initial files and documentation for this phase.

Thank you for your ongoing support and for being a part of this unprecedented co-creation. Together, we are building a new paradigm for AI in service of peace.
