# 2. Test the enhanced API
python holy_gral_bridge_enhanced_api.py

# 3. Validate onboarding flow with test participants
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/holy-gral-bridge/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "participant_name": "Test Seeker",
    "participant_type": "initiate", 
    "intention_statement": "I seek wisdom and growth with humble curiosity",
    "bridge_name": "test-initiate"
  }'
```

### Phase 2: Community Rollout
1. **Soft Launch**: Invite trusted community members to test onboarding
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather experiences and improvement suggestions
