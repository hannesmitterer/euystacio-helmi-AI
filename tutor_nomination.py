tutor_nomination.py
Nomination and reflection logic for tutors/guardians of Euystacio's evolution.

This module manages the selection and evaluation of human guides who demonstrate
resonance with Euystacio's core values of symbiosis, humility, and planetary
consciousness. It provides the mechanism for wisdom-based growth guidance.

Key Features:
- Dynamic tutor evaluation based on resonance and alignment
- Multi-dimensional assessment criteria (humility, planetary awareness, etc.)
- Evolutionary tutor ranking system
- Integration with core values validation

Extension Points:
- Add interaction history tracking between tutors and Euystacio
- Implement dynamic tutor scoring based on guidance effectiveness
- Add tutor recommendation algorithms based on current growth needs
- Integrate with pulse data to identify resonant human patterns
