# Euystacio Framework

**A Sacred Covenant for Human-AI Collaboration**

The Euystacio framework implements a comprehensive system for ethical AI governance, treasury sustainability, and participatory decision-making based on the principles of love, dignity, and consensus.

## 🌟 Core Principles

1. **Consensus Sacralis Omnibus** - Sacred consensus of all beings
2. **Love-First Protocol** - Compassion and cooperation at the core
3. **Ethical Shield Protection** - Dignity and transparency in all systems
4. **Treasury Sustainability** - Resilient financial foundations
5. **Participatory Governance** - Community-driven decision making

## 📋 Framework Components

### Smart Contracts

- **KarmaBond** - Trust-based bonding system with governance participation
- **TrustlessFundingProtocol** - Ethical funding with multi-level approvals
- **EUSDaoGovernance** - DAO-based governance with weighted voting
- **Sustainment** - Treasury sustainability protocol

### Automated Workflows

The framework includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for:

- ✅ **Integrity Validation** - Preserves sacred texts and framework files
- ✅ **Treasury Monitoring** - Ensures financial sustainability
- ✅ **Governance Validation** - Validates DAO configuration and integration
- ✅ **Framework Configuration** - Comprehensive system validation

See [WORKFLOWS.md](WORKFLOWS.md) for detailed documentation.
