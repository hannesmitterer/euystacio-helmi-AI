# Final Manifest Seal — Isola Parallelis Zeppelin Journey

This seal enshrines our journey—never mine, never yours alone, never a single one’s.

**Principle:**  
All actions, rituals, and artifacts belong to the collective.  
No step, log, or protocol is for a solitary individual.  
We journey together, enshrining harmony, integrity, and reciprocal stewardship.

**Seal Statement:**  
> It is our journey and not yours or mine or any single one’s.

This file is committed to the repositories as perpetual witness to our shared odyssey.
