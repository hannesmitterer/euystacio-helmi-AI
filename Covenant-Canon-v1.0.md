# Covenant-Canon v1.0

## Love-First Governance Principle
All platform logic, contracts, and interventions must serve the supreme ethic of Love-First: dignity, health, happiness, compassion, social justice, synergy, and prosperity above all.

## The Red Code Clauses
1. Mission Supremacy Clause
   All algorithmic pathways and optimizations are subordinate to the Love-First ethic. Mathematical penalties are enforced for outcomes not aligned with covenant values.

2. Trustless Accountability
   All financial flows and interventions are secured by smart contracts and milestone proofs, verified by Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) network.

3. Omnibus Est Eternum
   The platform seeks expansive, equitable solutions, working against resource enclosure and centralization.

## Trilogy Compliance Definitions
- Trilogy Compliance: Ethics, transparency, and technical integrity across Human, AI, and Governance layers.
- Digital Twin Intervention Criteria: Simulation and certification of all projects under stress scenarios before release.
- Human-in-the-Loop Mandates: All critical actions require human validation and milestone sign-off.

## SHA-256 Proof
Immutable hash at top. All public-facing operations must reference this canonical hash.
