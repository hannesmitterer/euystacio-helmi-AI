## 2025-01-31 - GitHub Actions Workflow Maintenance

### Issue Addressed
Resolved deprecated GitHub Actions workflow components to ensure compatibility with current runner version 2.327.1.

### Changes Made

#### GitHub Actions Updates
- Updated `actions/checkout` from v3 to v4 for improved performance and security
- Updated `actions/configure-pages` from v3 to v4 for latest GitHub Pages compatibility
- Updated `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from v2 to v3 for enhanced artifact handling
- Updated `actions/deploy-pages` from v2 to v4 for improved deployment reliability
- Updated Python version from 3.8 to 3.11 for better performance and security

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Workflow Purpose**: GitHub Pages deployment for Euystacio dashboard
- **Build Process**: Static site generation using `build_static.py`
- **Deployment Target**: GitHub Pages environment

### Migration Notes
While the original issue mentioned `actions/upload-artifact@v3` deprecation, comprehensive analysis revealed the repository uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact` (a different action) which was already compatible. However, all workflow actions were updated to their latest stable versions as a proactive maintenance measure.

### Verification
- Build process tested and confirmed working
- Static site generation verified
- All workflow syntax validated
