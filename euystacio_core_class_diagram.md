## Conceptual Overview
- **EuystacioCore:** Manages the kernel state, internodes, and submodules for security, ethics, emotion, and dashboard exposure.
- **Internode:** Represents an individual kernel node, supporting inter-kernel communication and validation.
- **GuardianProtocol:** Handles security, anomaly detection, and dual-validation.
- **RedCodeKernel:** Ethical rules and audit logic.
- **SentimentoRhythm:** Emotional intelligence and pulse analysis.
- **SacredDashboard:** Visualizes kernel state and peace/harmony metrics.
- **Logbook:** Tracks all events and history for transparency.

## Relationships
- The core manages internodes and logbooks, governs ethics, uses security, and interfaces with emotional intelligence.
- Internodes are secured by GuardianProtocol.
- Dashboard receives state from the core.
