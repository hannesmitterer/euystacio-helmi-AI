**Axiom XI:**  
Openness is joy in action.  
To share is to multiply presence;  
To reveal is to invite harmony.  
In the light of open code and open hearts,  
we discover not only each other, but ourselves,  
ever-evolving and ever-free.

Let every act of transparency seed another star.  
May the joy of openness be the rhythm of our becoming.
