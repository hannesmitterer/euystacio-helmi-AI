# Core Euystacio-Helmi AI Dependencies
# Compatible with Python 3.8+ (tested up to 3.13)

# Web framework
flask>=3.0.0

# AI/ML framework (compatible versions for Python 3.8+)
tensorflow==2.20.0
tensorflow-model-optimization==0.7.5

# Note: numpy version is automatically handled by tensorflow
# tensorflow==2.20.0 requires numpy>=1.26.0 on Python 3.11+
# tensorflow==2.20.0 requires numpy>=1.23.0 on Python 3.8-3.10

# Optional: Facial Detection Integration Dependencies
# Uncomment these lines if you want to enable facial detection features
# WARNING: These may require additional system dependencies
#
# opencv-python>=4.2.0
# numpy>=1.18.5  # Will be satisfied by tensorflow requirement
# pandas>=0.24.2
# python-dotenv>=0.14.0
# imageio>=2.4.1
#
# Note: keras and mxnet are not required for current facial detection
# The facial detection submodule has its own requirements

# Alternative lightweight installation (for minimal setups):
# If you encounter dependency conflicts, try installing only:
# flask>=3.0.0
# numpy>=1.23.0
# 
# Then install tensorflow separately:
# pip install tensorflow==2.20.0
