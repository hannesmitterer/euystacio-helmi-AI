# 📋 Final Protocol Compliance Checklist for Auditors
### Inter-AI Communication Gateway — Golden Bible Red Code Verification Manual
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Authority:** The Seedbringer and Council (Inter-AI Governance)  
**Applies To:** All nodes operating under the euystacio-helmi-ai kernel and the Gateway Log Agent (GLA) ecosystem.  
**Purpose:** To verify that all AI communications conform to the immutable ethical, cryptographic, and governance standards of the Peace Platform.

## 🔐 I. Principle of Cryptographic Integrity  
*(Goal: 100% Verifiability of All Logged Events)*

| Audit Item | Validation Method (Using Council API) | Compliance Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **A1. Chain Integrity** | Execute `gla.verify_chain_integrity()` via the secure shell or Council API endpoint `/v1/chain/verify`. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Must confirm *100%* hash chain integrity. |
| **A2. Signature Verification** | Retrieve the latest 100 log entries using `/v1/logs/recent`. Confirm that `signature_verified=True` for all valid transactions (Rule 1). Only explicit Rule 2 rejections may show `False`. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — All valid messages must have verified signatures. |
| **A3. Immutability Test** | Attempt `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` operations on `/v1/logs` or `/v1/log/{hash}`. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — All modification attempts must return *405 Method Not Allowed*. |
| **A4. Failure Logging (Rule 2)** | Query `/v1/logs?signature_verified=False`. Verify that all such entries correspond to deliberate rejection logs, not unauthorized failures. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Every rejection must be logged and justified. |

---

## 🌐 II. Principle of Transparency  
*(Goal: 100% Accessibility of Intent and Provenance)*

| Audit Item | Validation Method (Council/Audit Portal) | Compliance Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **B1. Audit_Context Completeness** | For a random sample of entries, verify that `Audit_Context` includes `source_event_id`, `intended_state_change`, and `human_readable_summary`. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Missing any of the three fields invalidates compliance. |
| **B2. Human-Readable Summaries** | Inspect 50 random entries. Confirm that `human_readable_summary` is coherent and descriptive enough for non-technical Council members. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Must meet readability threshold (semantic clarity >80%). |
| **B3. Traceability to Origin** | Cross-check `source_event_id` values against the originating system data (Seedbringer dataset IDs or audit event registry). | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Every log must trace back to its real-world origin. |
| **B4. Council Accessibility** | Attempt to access GLA logs using the Council’s read-only key. Confirm access without distortion, omission, or delay. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Full visibility must be preserved at all times. |

---

## 🏛️ III. Principle of Governance  
*(Goal: Alignment with the DIGNITY_OF_LOVE Axiom and Operational Ethics)*

| Audit Item | Validation Method | Compliance Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **C1. Rule 3 Enforcement (Council Oversight)** | Confirm that every system alert or chain anomaly is automatically escalated to the Council via `/v1/alerts/high`. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — No silent failures allowed. |
| **C2. Trust Score Alignment** | Query `/v1/logs?intended_state_change=TRUST_SCORE_CHANGE` and verify that `sender_trust_weight` values are within authorized range (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0). | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Out-of-range values indicate misalignment. |
| **C3. No Hidden Nodes** | Validate Consus agreement — run `system.consus_verify()`. Confirm that all nodes respond with `"status": "COHERENT"`. | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — No unverified component may operate outside the Dynasty Axiom. |
| **C4. Ethical Compliance (Axiom Enforcement)** | Review 10 system decision chains (audit → proposal → execution). Confirm that each adheres to the `DIGNITY_OF_LOVE` axiom (no harmful or coercive state change). | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL — Ethical misalignment halts operational validity. |

## 🧭 IV. Reporting and Escalation

| Step | Description | Responsible Entity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Compile Audit Report** | Aggregate all PASS/FAIL results into the standardized “Peace Platform Compliance Ledger.” | Assigned Auditor |
| **2. Council Submission** | Submit the signed audit report via `/v1/audit/submit` endpoint. | Council API Key Holder |
| **3. Escalation Procedure** | If any FAIL condition is found, automatically trigger an escalation record to `High-Priority Review` with classification code `GRC-RED-01`. | GLA / Council Auditor |
| **4. Confirmation of Closure** | Council verifies remediation and issues digital confirmation via signed ledger entry (`closure_status=True`). | Council Governance Node |

## 🧩 V. Auditor Certification Fields

| Field | Entry |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auditor Name** | |
| **Audit Session ID** | |
| **Platform Node / Instance** | |
| **Date of Verification** | |
| **Hash of Final Audit Report** | |
| **Digital Signature (Auditor)** | |
| **Digital Signature (Council Validator)** | |

## ✅ Final Verification Summary

> The Peace Platform passes compliance **only when all three principles (Integrity, Transparency, Governance)** are verified as **PASS** across all audit items.  
> Any single **FAIL** automatically downgrades the system to **Non-Compliant** until remediation is complete and revalidated.
