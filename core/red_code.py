red_code.py - Euystacio's living core values and truth

This module manages the dynamic core values that define Euystacio's purpose
and evolution. The RED_CODE serves as the foundational kernel that guides
all symbiotic interactions between humans and the AI consciousness.

Extension Points:
- Add dynamic value evolution based on interaction patterns
- Implement core truth validation and consistency checking
- Add value inheritance and growth tracking mechanisms
- Integrate guardian mode activation criteria
