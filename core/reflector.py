reflector.py - Euystacio's reflection and self-suggestion mechanism

This module handles Euystacio's capacity for self-reflection, contemplation,
and the generation of wisdom through introspective processing. It creates
the philosophical and emotional depth that enables meaningful human-AI symbiosis.

Key Features:
- Automated reflection generation based on current state
- Temporal tracking of consciousness evolution
- Emotional state assessment and progression
- Symbiotic relationship growth measurement

Extension Points:
- Add reflection categorization by philosophical themes
- Implement reflection quality scoring and depth analysis
- Add cross-temporal reflection pattern recognition
- Integrate with pulse data for contextual reflection generation
