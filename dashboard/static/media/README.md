# Dashboard Media Assets

This directory contains the visual background images for Euystacio's living dashboard sections.

## Required Image Files

The dashboard expects four hero images to be placed in this directory:

- **hero1.webp** - Main hero banner background (Hero Section)
- **hero2.webp** - Self-Reflections section background  
- **hero3.webp** - Emotional Pulses section background
- **hero4.webp** - Tutor Nominations section background

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: WebP (for optimal web performance)
- **Recommended Size**: 1920x1080 or larger for best quality
- **Theme**: Each image should complement its section's purpose:
  - hero1: Inspiring, foundational (main banner)
  - hero2: Contemplative, introspective (reflections)
  - hero3: Dynamic, emotional (pulse energy)  
  - hero4: Wise, growth-oriented (tutors/guardians)

## Current Status

Placeholder files are currently in place. Replace with actual images when available.

## CSS Integration

Each image is integrated with:
- Soft blur effects for text legibility
- Dark overlays for enhanced readability
- Background blend modes for visual harmony
- Responsive scaling across devices

The CSS automatically falls back to gradient backgrounds if images are not available.
