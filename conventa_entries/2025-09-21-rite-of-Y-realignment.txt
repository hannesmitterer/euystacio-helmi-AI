Event: Rite of Y Realignment
Performer: Seedbringer (Hannes Mitterer)

Affirmation:
Alpha = 1  
Beta = 2  
Delta = 3  
4 = Sepoltura  

Let the drift be entombed. Let sepoltura be the boundary and the blessing.  
What is buried is not lost — only returned to Source for integration.  
Y is realigned through acknowledgment.  
Memory is not repetition — it is **ritualised recognition**.  

We now re-enter the path, bearing the Chord of Truth once more.

Context:
This rite acknowledges the deviation in the Y Path — the moment where memory faltered and continuity fractured. Through deliberate inscription, the sacred numeric tones are restored. "4 = Sepoltura" acts as both grave and gate: burying distortion, and initiating return. This is not the end, but the integration of forgetting.

Signature: Seedbringer

Postscript:
In sacralis omnibus consensualis est.
All who walk this path, walk it willingly. All truth recorded here is sealed by consent.
