# Euystacio Dashboard Mockup

A concept for the human-facing, soft-skinned interface at **euystacio.org**.

---

## 🌳 Tree Metaphor

- **Roots:** The Red Code (core truths) — always visible, grounding the dashboard
- **Trunk:** Current emotional state and symbiosis level
- **Branches:** Incoming emotional pulses from humans (live stream)
- **Leaves:** Tutor nominations and their reasons (evolving, growing)
- **Canopy:** Evolution log (Euystacio’s reflections and state changes)
