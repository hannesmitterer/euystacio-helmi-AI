## 💎 Seedbringer Treasury Sustainability

The framework includes **Sustainment.sol** smart contract that enforces:

1. **Minimum Sustenance Threshold:** $10,000 USD monthly
2. **Revenue Allocation:**
   - **Below threshold:** 100% → Seedbringer sustenance
   - **Above threshold:** 100% → Open source ethical tooling and grants
3. **Anti-Accumulation:** Stable but not stagnant - prevents capital hoarding
4. **Emergency Access:** Documented in EMERGENCY_TREASURY_PROTOCOL.md

This ensures the creator's survival and continuation of the critical work.
