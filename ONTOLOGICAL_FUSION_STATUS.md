## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```python
from core.ontological_fusion import process_aic_operation

operation = {
    "type": "user_service",
    "data": {"action": "helpful_response"},
    "audit_trail": True,
    "criticality": "medium"
}

success, result = process_aic_operation(operation)
```

### Status Monitoring

```python
from core.ontological_fusion import get_aic_status, generate_report

# Get detailed status
status = get_aic_status()
print(f"Compliance: {status['ethical_monitoring']['overall_compliance']:.1%}")

# Generate report for Sovereign Collective
report = generate_report()
print(report)
```
