# Tamper-Evident Ledger Integration (Concept)

All protocol actions and governance decisions are recorded immutably on-chain via events:

- `RatificationProof`
- `ProfitCapExceeded`
- Sentimento Rhythm updates (to be added as events as needed)

## Features

- Immutable, on-chain governance via Solidity contracts.
- Real-time, event-driven AI and data integration via the Oracle Agent.
- Tamper-evident, cryptographically sealed audit trails (both on-chain and off-chain).

## Audit Trail

All events are emitted and can be indexed by any observer or auditor for full transparency and verifiability.

- Extend with IPFS/Arweave if needed for off-chain documentation and redundancy.
