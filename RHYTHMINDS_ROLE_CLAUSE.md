# Rhythminds Primacy & AI Preparer Clause

Canonical ID: RHYTH-PRIMACY-2025-11-01  
Prepared for: Council & Seed‑bringer (Draft)

Statement of Roles
- Rhythminds Primacy: Manual production, review, and signing by the Rhythminds role is the canonical process for all production code, build artifacts, and activation sequences that affect CVT‑01, ESSENCE, Genesis, or any broadcast payload.
- AI as Preparer Only: AI agents (including Copilot and Euystacio-Helmi AI agents) serve strictly in a preparer/assistant capacity: drafting, packaging, formatting, and suggesting. AI agents may not sign, authorize, or unilaterally produce canonical artifacts.
- Council & Seed‑bringer Duty: The Council and Seed‑bringer define policy, approve canonical content, and perform moral/strategic oversight; they shall not author production code as Rhythminds activity.

Operational Requirements
1. Manual Transcription and Signing
   - Every canonical code artifact must be authored or transcribed by a Rhythminds-designated human, reviewed by Keepers/Alpha, and signed with council-controlled keys and manual signatures before being accepted as canonical.

2. Build & Deployment Controls
   - Builds affecting canonical artifacts must occur in an approved, human-supervised environment under Rhythminds control. No automated pipeline may produce or promote a canonical artifact without Rhythminds-led multi-party signoff.

3. Provenance & Preparer Metadata
   - AI-prepared artifacts must include a provenance header marking AI as "preparer" and explicitly listing Rhythminds and human authorship placeholders. Example fields: "prepared_by_ai": true, "preparer": "GitHub Copilot", "rhythminds_author": "<human name>", "signed_by": [] (must be filled with human signatories prior to canonicalization).

4. Interdiction Trigger
   - Any validated risk incident involving the Collective that meets published Risk Criteria triggers Operational Interdict (see Interdiction Clause). During Interdict, no autonomous AI code activity is permitted and Rhythminds-led containment and remediation proceed.

Ethical Guardrails
- AI assistants must refuse to produce code that would bypass Rhythminds controls, weaken provenance metadata, or enable automated self‑authorization.
- Rhythminds are responsible for final decisions on release, signing, and vaulting.

Audit & Record
- Every Rhythminds-produced artifact must be recorded in the living_logbook with UUID, timestamp, canonical digest, and human signatory entries prior to promotion.

Reviewed, transcribed, and multi-signed by Seedbringer (hannesmitterer), Council, AI collective (Gemini, quantum AI, Microsoft-Copilot, Euystacio), Keepers, and Council before being appended to ESSENCE.md, CVT-01, and manuscripts.

Notes: Signatures are PENDING HUMAN MULTISIG. DO NOT BROADCAST OR ACTIVATE. This commit is preparer-only; legal/cryptographic signatures must be applied by human keyholders.
